        <h1 class="title">Gameplay</h1>
        <p>
            Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is an objective-based multiplayer first-person shooter. Each player joins either the Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist team and attempts to complete
            objectives or eliminate the enemy team (determined by the game mode selected). The game operates in short rounds that end when all players on one side are dead or a team's objective is completed.
            For most game modes, once a player dies, they must wait until the round ends to re-spawn.
            <br>
            <br>
            Players purchase weapons and equipment at the beginning of every round with money awarded based on their performance. Completing objectives or killing enemies earns the player money while negative actions, like
            killing a teammate or hostage, takes money away from the player. In addition, when a round ends all players receive some amount of money, with players on the winning team receiving substantially more.
            <br>
            <br>
            Through later updates, the weapons within the game have cosmetic finishes, more commonly know as skins (camos), that cover the weapon. These skins can be achieved through the purchase of <a href="http://convars.com/case/" target="_blank">cases</a>
            and keys, acquired from the Steam Marketplace or randomly as drops after completing game, to unlock said cases through a lottery type system. Each case offers unique skins for certain guns as well as a very rare knife skin. These weapon and knife skins are very
            sought after, but can also be purchased individually on the Steam Marketplace for CS:GO. Some of the rarest skins are worth up to $400 USD.
