        <h1 class="title">Competitive</h1>
            <p>
                This is the game mode that made Counter-Strike famous. Team up with friends, or go in by yourself, and join a 5v5 best-of-30 match using standard competitive Counter-Strike rules on one of the classic maps as Counter Terrorists (CT) or as the Terrorists (T).
                You can join a match on your own, or form a team and enter a match as a unit and must commit to the full game, otherwise you'll face a cool down penalty if you leave. This cool down penalty prevents you from playing
                the Competitive game mode for a certain amount of time depending of how often you leave in progress game. You can also be kicked from the game for killing three teammates a game or if you deal too much damage to your teammates.
                Competitive involves Bomb Scenario and Hostage Scenario missions. At the start of each round, players can buy weapons and equipment with money earned from various actions, from assisting on kills to completing objectives. Regardless of mission type, a
                round ends when one team completes an objective, eliminates the other team, or lets the timer run out. If the timer runs out before one of these objectives are completed, the defending team wins.
                <br>
                <br>
                Bomb Scenario: the Terrorists must plant C4 explosive at one of two designated bombsites and protect it until it detonates; the Counter-Terrorists must defend the bomb sites, either
                ensuring that the terrorist team does not plant the C4 or they must defuse it once it's planted. If the CT team does defuse it, the CT team will still win regardless how many enemy team members are still alive.
                <br>
                <br>
                Hostage Scenario: the Counter-Terrorists must rescue hostages from the Terrorists and bring them to an extraction point; the Terrorists must prevent the hostages from escaping. If a Terrorist or Counter-Terrorist
                attempts to kill hostage, they will suffer a heavy cash penalty.
                <br>
                <br>
                Within the competitive game mode there is also a player ranking system that ranks players based on their performance and wins within the game mode. The lowest rank being that of Silver 1 (with five other sub-ranks),
                Gold Nova 1 (with three other sub-ranks), Master Guardian 1, (with three sub-ranks), Legendary Eagle (with one sub-rank), Supreme Master First Class, and The Global Elite being the highest ranked players in the world.

        <h1 class="title">Casual</h1>
            <p>
                The Casual game mode follows the same rules, guidelines, and scenarios as the Competitive game mode - though player rank doesn't have an effect into the matchmaking process., but in this game mode, you donâ€™t have to commit to a full match.
                In the Casual game mode, players automatically receive body armor and defuse kits and gain bonus rewards for kills. And instead of it being 5v5, it's 10v10.
                <hr>
            </p>

        <h1 class="title">Demolition</h1>
            <p>
                In the demolition game mode, players take turns attacking and defending a single bombsite in a series of maps designed for fast-paced gameplay. Players are automatically granted a starting weapon, and advance through a sequence of weapons when they earn
                a kill. If you can earn a kill each round you reach the ultimate weapons, powerful sniper rifles!
                <hr>
            </p>

        <h1 class="title">Deathmatch</h1>
        <p>
            Deathmatch is a simple gamemode where the Counter-Terrorists are pitted against the Terrorist in a straight-up blood bath. The games are 10-minutes long where the person/team with the highest score at the end of those 10-minutes
            is/are the winners. In deathmatch there is no money involved like in Competitive and Casual; the players get to choose their primary and secondary weapon, with everyone granted armor, but no usable equipment. Each
            gun has a set point reward granted upon kills obtained with that weapon.
        </p>

        <h1 class="title">Arm's Race</h1>
        <p>
            Arm's Race is a deathmatch-based game mode where each player is rewarded for every two kills on a particular level. The player will then receive a new weapon by leveling up to the next level. The gold knife is the final weapon
            a player receives, and the first player to score a kill with the gold knife wins the game along with their team.
            <br>
            <br>
            After a death, the player will immediately re-spawn with a short spawn protection time to prevent spawn killing. Much like deathmatch, once the player moves the spawn protection is quickly removed. Re-spawning will leave the player with
            the same weapon being used prior to death, unless the player was killed with a knife or by committing suicide. Doing so, will cause the player to revert to the previous weapon.
